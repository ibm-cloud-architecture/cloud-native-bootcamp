# Cloud Native Applications

## What is Cloud-Native?

Cloud-native is about how we build and run applications taking full
advantage of cloud computing rather than worrying about where we deploy
it.

Cloud-native refers less to where an application resides and more to how
it is built and deployed.

-   A cloud-native application consists of discrete, reusable components
    known as microservices that are designed to integrate into any cloud
    environment.

-   These microservices act as building blocks and are often packaged in
    containers.

-   Microservices work together as a whole to comprise an application,
    yet each can be independently scaled, continuously improved, and
    quickly iterated through automation and orchestration processes.

-   The flexibility of each microservice adds to the agility and
    continuous improvement of cloud-native applications.

## Why Cloud-Native?

Cloud-native applications are different from the traditional
applications that run in your data centres. The applications that are
designed in the traditional way are not built keeping cloud
compatibility in mind. They may have strong ties with the internal
systems. Also, they cannot take advantage of all the benefits of the
cloud.

So, we need a new architecture for our applications to utilize the
benefits of cloud. There is a need to design the applications keeping
cloud in mind and take advantage of several cloud services like storage,
queuing, caching etc.

-   Speed, safety, and scalability comes with cloud-native applications.

-   Helps you to quickly deliver the advancements.

-   Allows you to have loose ties into the corporate IT where it most
    certainly would destabilize legacy architectures.

-   Helps you to continuously deliver your applications with zero
    downtime.

-   Infrastructure is less predictable.

-   Service instances are all disposable.

-   Deployments are immutable.

-   To meet the expectations of the todayâ€™s world customers, these
    systems are architected for elastic scalability.
